    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>URIs were previously defined in <xref target="RFC1738"/>, which was updated by <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  Those documents also specify how to define schemes for URIs.</t>
      <t>The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in <xref target="RFC1738"/>.  Because that document has been made obsolete, this document copies the file URI scheme from it to allow that material to remain on standards track.</t>
      <section title="Conventions and Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="History" anchor="history">
      <t>The file URI scheme was first defined in <xref target="RFC1630"/>, an informational RFC which does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  The definition was standardised in <xref target="RFC1738"/>, and the scheme was registered with IANA, however the latter definition omitted certain language from former that clarified aspects such as:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>the use of slashes to donate boundaries between directory levels of a hierarchical file system</t>
          <t>the requirement that client software convert the file URL into a file name in the local file name conventions</t>
          <t>a justification for defining the scheme.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The Internet draft <xref target="I-D.draft-hoffman-file-uri"/> was written in an effort to keep the file URI scheme on standards track when <xref target="RFC1738"/> was made obsolete, but the draft expired in 2005.  That draft enumerated concerns arising from the various, often conflicting implementations.</t>
      <t>Despite lacking a living standard, the file URI scheme is used by way of example in <xref target="RFC3986"/> three times:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>section 1.1 [p6] uses "file:///etc/hosts" as an example</t>
          <t>section 1.2.3 [p10] mentions the "file" scheme regarding relative references</t>
          <t>section 3.2.2 [p21] says that '...the "file" URI scheme is defined so that no authority, an empty host, and "localhost" all mean the end-user's machine...'.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Finally the WHATWG defines a <xref target="WHATWG">living URL standard</xref>, which includes algorithms for interpreting file URIs.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Scheme Definition" anchor="scheme">
      <t>The file URI scheme is used to designate files accessible on a particular host computer.  This scheme, unlike most other URI schemes, does not designate a resource that is universally accessible over the Internet.</t>
      <t>The file URI scheme has historically had little or no interoperability between platforms.  Further, implementers on a single platform have often disagreed on the syntax to use for a particular filesystem.</t>
      <t>Note that file and ftp URIs are not the same, even when the target of the ftp URI is the local host.</t>
      <t>A file URI conforms with the generic syntax presented in <xref target="RFC3986"/>, with the following components:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="scheme name">The literal value <spanx style="verb">file</spanx></t>
            <t hangText="authority">If present, either the fully qualified domain name of the system on which the file is accessible;  or one of the special values <spanx style="verb">localhost</spanx> or the empty string, in which case it is interpreted as "the machine from which the URI is being interpreted".  An absent authority component SHOULD be interpreted as if it were present and had the value <spanx style="verb">localhost</spanx>.</t>
            <t>A host name, if supplied, is intended to inform a client on a remote machine that it cannot access the file system, or perhaps to use some other mechanism to access the file.  It does not imply that the file should be accessible over a network connection.</t>
            <t hangText="path">The hierarchical directory path to the file, using the slash character ("/") to separate directories.  Implementations MUST translate between the URI syntax and the local system's conventions for specifying file paths, where they differ.</t>
            <t>Systems exhibit different levels of case-sensitivity.  Implementations SHOULD attempt to maintain the case of file and directory names when translating file URIs to and from local file paths, and any devices that transport file URIs MUST NOT alter the case of file URIs they transport.</t>
            <t>Some systems allow file URIs to point to directories.  In this case, there is usually (but not always) a terminating slash character, such as in:
              <figure><artwork type="inline">file:///usr/local/bin/</artwork></figure>
            </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        On systems running some versions of Microsoft Windows, the local drive specification is sometimes specified with a colon character (":") and sometimes with a pipe ("|").  The two SHOULD be considered equivalent, and any implementation which may interact with a Microsoft Windows environment SHOULD interpret a single letter followed by either a colon or pipe character in the first segment of the path as a drive letter.  For example, the following URIs:
        <figure><artwork type="inline">file:///c:/windows/example.ini
file:///c|/windows/example.ini</artwork></figure>
        when interpreted on the same machine, would refer to the same file:
        <figure><artwork type="inline">c:\windows\example.ini</artwork></figure>
      </t>
      <t>Note that some systems running some versions of Microsoft Windows are known to omit the slash before the drive letter, effectively replacing the authority component with the drive specification.  In line with Postel's robustness principle ("an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior" <xref target="RFC791"/>) implementations that are likely to encounter such a URI MAY interpret it as intended, but SHOULD NOT generate such URIs.</t>
      <t>For Windows shares, such as those accessed using the <xref target="MS-SMB2">SMB/CIFS protocol</xref>, there is an additional slash prepended to the path.  Thus, the file "example.doc" on the shared directory "departments" would have the URI
        <figure><artwork type="inline">file:////departments/example.doc</artwork></figure>
      </t>
      <t>The file URI scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an Internet protocol or access method for such files; as such, its utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Implementation Notes" anchor="implementation">
      <section title="Hierarchical Structure">
        <t>Most implementations of the file URI scheme do a reasonable job of mapping the hierarchical part of a directory structure into the "/" delimited hierarchy of the URI syntax, independent of what the native platform delimiter is.</t>
        <t>For example, on Windows platforms, it is typical that the file system presents backslash "\" as the file delimeter for file names, yet the URI's forward slash "/" can be used in file URIs.  Similarly, on (some) Macintosh OS versions, at least in some contexts, the colon (":") is used as the delimiter in the native presentation of file path names.  Unix systems natively use the same forward slash "/" delimiter for hierarchy, so there is a closer mapping between file paths and native path names.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Drives, drive letters, mount points, file system root">
        <t>Historically there has been considerable difference, in practice, for handling of the syntax for the "top" of the hierarchy.  The file URI syntax provides one simple place for designating the root of the file hierachy, and implementations have diverged, even on the same platform, sometimes even within a single application.</t>
        <t>For example, DOS- and Windows-based systems support the notion of a "drive letter", a single character which represents a (virtual) drive, mount point, or device.  Native representations of file paths start with the drive letter, a colon, and then the path; e.g., "c:\tmp\test.txt".</t>
        <t>Drive letters are mapped into the top of a file URI in various ways, depending on the implementation; some applications substitute vertical bar ("|") for the colon after the drive letter, yielding "file:///c|/tmp/test.txt".  In some cases, the colon is left unchanged, as in "file:///c:/tmp/test.txt".  In other cases, the colon is simply omitted, as in "file:///c/tmp/test.txt".</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Character sets and encodings">
        <t>Local file systems sometimes use many different encodings for representing file names.  The URI syntax defined in <xref target="RFC3986"/> provides a method of encoding data, presumably for the sake of identifying a resource, as a sequence of characters.  The URI characters are, in turn, frequently encoded as octets for transport or presentation.  This specification does not mandate any particular character encoding for mapping between URI characters and the octets used to store or transmit those characters, however for interoperability sake, it would be preferable for file URI libraries to translate the native character encoding for file names to and from Unicode.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
      <t>File access and the granting of privileges for specific operations are complex topics, and the use of file URIs can complicate the security model in effect for file privileges.  Under no circumstance should software using file URIs grant greater access than would be available for other file access methods.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">
      <t>This document does not modify the existing entry in the <xref target="IANA">URI Schemes registry</xref>, except by updating its reference RFC.</t>
